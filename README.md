## Overview
This is a practice based front end project, one can do it with plane HTML, CSS and js or using frameworks.
This project is about building a simple two-sided-card with result and summary sections, result sections contains score out of 100 and a tag with its guideline text, while summary shows scores of each category. images like qr and favicon and icons of the categories are given, more importantly the finial design is also given.

## My process
 Using HTML, CSS and JS Learnings, I start implementing UI design from the outer most main components like container and section then putting all the sub-components, then comes the most interesting part you might have guessed it is called CSS Styling.
off course, it backs life in it, colors, images and design was given already so it became easy to full fill it.
